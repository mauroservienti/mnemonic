# mnemonic — Agent Context

⚠️ **WHEN WORKING ON MNEMONIC: Always test changes with local MCP server first (`npm run mcp:local` or `scripts/mcp-local.sh`)**

A personal MCP memory server. Stores LLM memories as plain markdown in a git repo with local embeddings via Ollama. No database or permanent services required.

## Dogfooding protocol

When working on mnemonic itself:
- Rebuild first: `npm run build`
- Use local MCP: `npm run mcp:local` or `scripts/mcp-local.sh`
- Use project-scoped `mnemonic` MCP for memory operations
- Exercise features through MCP tools (`remember`, `update`, `get`, `relate`, `recall`)
- Mnemoize decisions and findings through MCP (never write `.mnemonic/` files directly)

### Capture triggers

Default to capturing important context through MCP without waiting to be reminded. In particular, capture when any of the following happens:

- A design or implementation decision is made and there is a clear "why"
- A bug, CI failure, portability issue, or environment trap is discovered
- A workaround or temporary constraint is introduced
- A plan is explicitly accepted, rejected, narrowed, or deferred
- Dogfooding reveals behavior that differs from assumptions
- New testing or CI conventions are established
- A migration, data-shape, or operational constraint is clarified

### End-of-task memory check

Before finishing substantial work on mnemonic, quickly check:

- What should future work remember about this change?
- Was any option deliberately rejected and why?
- Did CI, local dogfooding, or production-like use reveal a non-obvious lesson?
- Is there a new convention that should be documented in memory or `AGENT.md`?

If the answer to any of these is yes, capture it through MCP before wrapping up.

**Troubleshooting:** Complex JSON payloads may fail via stdio due to shell escaping. Write to temp file first:
```bash
cat > /tmp/request.json << 'JSON'
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{...}}
JSON
(
  echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":0,"method":"initialize",...}'
  cat /tmp/request.json
) | ./scripts/mcp-local.sh
```

## Git commit message protocol

All memory-modifying tools follow standardized commits via `formatCommitBody()` in `src/index.ts`:

```
tool(action): Brief description

Human-readable summary.

- Note: <id> (<title>)
- Notes: <count> notes affected
  - <id-1>
  - <id-2>
- Project: <project-name>
- Scope: project|global
- Tags: <tag1>, <tag2>
- Relationship: <from-id> <type> <to-id>
- Mode: <mode>
- Description: <additional context>
```

### Tool conventions

| Tool | Subject format | Summary source | Body fields |
|------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| `remember` | `remember: <title>` | `summary` param or first sentence | Summary, Note, Project, Scope, Tags |
| `update` | `update: <title>` | `summary` param or "Updated X, Y, Z" | Summary, Note, Project, Tags |
| `forget` | `forget: <title>` | "Deleted note and cleaned up N reference(s)" | Summary, Note, Project |
| `move` | `move: <title>` | "Moved from X-vault to Y-vault" | Summary, Note, Project |
| `relate` | `relate: <title1> ↔ <title2>` | Context of relationship | Summary, Note, Project, Relationship |
| `unrelate` | `unrelate: <id1> ↔ <id2>` | Context of removal | Summary, Note, Project |
| `consolidate` | `consolidate(<mode>): <title>` | `mergePlan.summary` or "Consolidated N notes" | Summary, Note(s), Project, Mode |
| `prune` | `prune: removed N superseded note(s)` | "Pruned N superseded notes" | Summary, Note(s) |
| `policy` | `policy: <project> default scope <scope>` | "Set default scope to X" | Summary, Project |

**LLM summary format:** Imperative mood, 50-72 chars, explain "why" not "what".

## Design decisions

### Markdown + YAML frontmatter
- Human-readable, git-diffable, one file per note (isolated conflicts), no lock-in

### Embeddings gitignored
- Derived data, recomputable; avoids binary merge conflicts
- Reindex on new machine is fast at personal scale
- `sync` auto-embeds pulled notes

### Project scoping via git remote URL
```
git@github.com:acme/myapp.git → github-com-acme-myapp
https://github.com/acme/myapp → github-com-acme-myapp
```
Ensures consistency across machines. Fallback: git remote → git root folder → directory name.

### Project-boosted recall
When `recall` called with `cwd`, project notes get **+0.15 cosine similarity boost** (not hard filter). Keeps global memories accessible while prioritizing project context.

### Multi-vault architecture
- **Main vault** (`~/mnemonic-vault`): Private global memories, own git repo
- **Project vault** (`<git-root>/.mnemonic/`): Project-specific memories, committed to project repo

### Routing rules
- `cwd` identifies project context (separate from write location)
- `remember` + `scope: "project"` → project vault (creates `.mnemonic/`)
- `remember` + `scope: "global"` → main vault (keeps project in frontmatter)
- `scope` omitted → use saved policy or fallback to `project` with `cwd`
- Policy `ask` → ask: "Project vault" or "Private main vault"
- `remember` without `cwd` → main vault
- `recall`, `list`, `get`, `sync`, `reindex` → project vault first, then main
- `relate`/`unrelate`/`forget` → any vault, commit per vault
- Main vault's own git repo excluded from detection (`isMainRepo()` guard)

### Main vault config
Machine-local settings in `~/mnemonic-vault/config.json`. Survives sessions without becoming memory notes. Includes `reindexEmbedConcurrency`, per-project policy defaults.

### Bidirectional sync
`sync` does: fetch → record HEAD → pull (rebase) → diff notes/ → push → embed arrivals. Single call, linear history. Syncs main vault; pass `cwd` for project vault too.

### MCP output style
Optimized for LLM consumption:

**Output rules:**
- Compact, semantically explicit text over structured payloads
- Always name **project association** and **storage location**
- Use stable labels: `project:`, `stored:`, `policy:`, `updated:`
- Answer first, then detail
- Shallow lists grouped by purpose
- Structured responses only if text fails repeatedly

**Token-efficiency:**
- Clarity first, tokens second
- Concise defaults, opt-in detail
- One summary tool over multiple calls
- Compress counts/state into single readable lines
- Don't over-shorten labels

**Formatting:**
- Short headings for orientation
- Bullets for enumerations/state
- Consistent wording for `project`, `scope`, `stored`, `policy`
- Explicit phrases: `project: mnemonic`, `stored: main-vault`

## Architecture

```
src/index.ts      — MCP server, tool registrations
src/storage.ts    — read/write notes (markdown) and embeddings (JSON)
src/embeddings.ts — Ollama client, cosine similarity
src/git.ts        — git operations via simple-git
src/project.ts    — detect project from git remote URL
src/vault.ts      — VaultManager: routing between vaults
```

### Key types

```typescript
type RelationshipType = "related-to" | "explains" | "example-of" | "supersedes";

interface Relationship {
  id: string;
  type: RelationshipType;
}

interface Note {
  id: string;           // slug-uuid
  title: string;
  content: string;      // markdown body
  tags: string[];
  project?: string;     // stable project id
  projectName?: string; // human-readable
  relatedTo?: Relationship[];
  createdAt: string;    // ISO 8601
  updatedAt: string;
}

interface EmbeddingRecord {
  id: string;
  model: string;
  embedding: number[];  // 768-dim for nomic-embed-text
  updatedAt: string;
}

interface SyncResult {
  hasRemote: boolean;
  pulledNoteIds: string[];
  deletedNoteIds: string[];
  pushedCommits: number;
}
```

### Vault layout

**Main vault** (`~/mnemonic-vault`):
```
~/mnemonic-vault/
  .gitignore          ← auto-written, contains "embeddings/"
  notes/              ← global memories
    <id>.md
  embeddings/         ← local only, never committed
    <id>.json
```

**Project vault** (`<git-root>/.mnemonic/`):
```
<git-root>/
  .mnemonic/
    .gitignore        ← auto-written, contains "embeddings/"
    notes/            ← project memories (committed)
      <id>.md
    embeddings/       ← local only, never committed
      <id>.json
```

**Note format:**
```markdown
---
title: JWT RS256 migration rationale
tags: [auth, jwt, architecture]
project: github-com-acme-myapp
projectName: myapp
relatedTo:
  - id: auth-bug-fix-a1b2c3d4
    type: related-to
  - id: security-policy-b5c6d7e8
    type: explains

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `VAULT_PATH` | `~/mnemonic-vault` | Vault location |
| `OLLAMA_URL` | `http://localhost:11434` | Ollama server |
| `EMBED_MODEL` | `nomic-embed-text` | Embedding model |
| `DISABLE_GIT` | `false` | Skip git ops if `"true"` |

## Stack

- **TypeScript** (Node16, ES2022)
- **@modelcontextprotocol/sdk** — MCP server
- **simple-git** — git operations
- **gray-matter** — markdown frontmatter parsing
- **zod** — schema validation
- **Ollama** (HTTP) — `nomic-embed-text` embeddings

## TypeScript patterns

### Exhaustive switch statements
```typescript
switch (consolidationMode) {
  case "delete":
    // handle
    break;
  case "supersedes":
    // handle
    break;
  default: {
    const _exhaustive: never = consolidationMode;
    throw new Error(`Unknown mode: ${_exhaustive}`);
  }
}
```

### String literal unions
```typescript
type ConsolidationMode = "supersedes" | "delete";
```

Prefer over enums — more lightweight, integrates better with JSON.

### Type inference
Let TypeScript infer when obvious; explicit types for function boundaries and public APIs.

### Unknown for dynamic data
Use `unknown` instead of `any` for external data (APIs, user input). Forces type checking before use.

## Testing Requirements

### Data format changes MUST have tests
Any change to note format, frontmatter schema, config structure, or relationships requires corresponding tests:

- **New frontmatter fields**: Test reading old notes without the field (should default), test writing new notes (include field), test migration path if needed
- **Field renames**: Test migration that renames field, test both old and new field names during transition period
- **New note versions**: Test `parseNote()` handles missing `memoryVersion` gracefully 
- **Config changes**: Test `MnemonicConfigStore` handles old configs, validates new fields
- **Relationship changes**: Test bidirectional consistency, cleanup on `forget`, validation of types

**Migration testing pattern** (see `tests/migration.test.ts`):
- Test dry-run mode shows correct changes
- Test execute mode modifies notes correctly
- Test idempotency (re-running doesn't break already-migrated notes)
- Test version comparison logic for all version schemes (0.1, 0.2, 1.0, etc.)
- Test error handling for malformed data
- Test per-vault isolation (project vault succeeds, main vault fails = OK)

**Test files mirrored to source structure**:
- `src/storage.ts` → `tests/storage.test.ts` (doesn't exist yet, add when needed)
- `src/vault.ts` → `tests/vault.test.ts`
- `src/migration.ts` → `tests/migration.test.ts`

**Running tests**:
```bash
npm test                    # all tests
npm test -- <file>          # specific test file
npm test -- --reporter=verbose  # detailed output
```

**Integration test environment**:
- `tests/mcp.integration.test.ts` must stay CI-safe: it runs the real `scripts/mcp-local.sh` entrypoint with `DISABLE_GIT=true`
- Do not require a real Ollama daemon in CI for that test; it injects a fake local embeddings endpoint via `OLLAMA_URL`
- Keep the test isolated to a temp `VAULT_PATH` so it never mutates the developer's real vault or repository state
- If you add more MCP integration tests, prefer the same pattern unless you explicitly need end-to-end Ollama verification

**CI failure learning workflow**:
- CI failure learnings are artifact-first: a failing run should produce a normalized artifact before anything is promoted into memory
- Promotion into mnemonic is manual via `workflow_dispatch`, not automatic on every failed run
- Avoid fixed notes for CI learnings; prefer one note per promoted incident or failure pattern
- Promoted CI learnings should include a stable `failure_signature` so repeated issues can be recognized later
- Do not make CI failure learning depend on a real Ollama daemon unless semantic clustering becomes a proven need

**Coverage expectations**:
- Migration code: 100% (users can't fix corrupt vaults easily)
- Storage read/write: 100% (data integrity is critical)
- Vault routing: 90%+ (core to correct note storage/retrieval)
- Frontmatter parsing: 100% (must handle malformed gracefully)

### Dogfooding required
Every data format change must be applied to mnemonic's own `.mnemonic/` vault before merging:
1. Implement change with tests
2. Run migration in dry-run mode
3. Execute actual migration
4. Verify notes correctly updated
5. Commit the migrated notes (shows real-world impact)

### Documentation for new tools
All new MCP tools MUST be documented in both AGENT.md and README.md:

- Add to Tools table in **AGENT.md** (keep alphabetically sorted)
- Add to Tools table in **README.md** (keep alphabetically sorted)
- Document all parameters in AGENT.md with clear types and descriptions
- Update example usage in README.md if applicable
- Run `npm test` to ensure no regressions

**Keep README.md and AGENT.md in sync** - they serve different audiences (README.md for users, AGENT.md for agents/developers).

## Critical constraints

- **One file per note** — git conflict isolation
- **Embeddings gitignored** — avoid binary merge conflicts; reindex if needed
- **Rebase on pull** — linear history
- **Project id from git remote URL** — cross-machine consistency
- **Similarity boost (not hard filter)** — keep global memories accessible
- **`simpleGit()` in `GitOps.init()`** — vault must exist first
- **Project vault in `.mnemonic/`** — shareable via git
- **`isMainRepo()` guard** — prevent main vault from being treated as project vault

## Known limitations

- **Bounded parallel embedding** — small concurrency limit during reindex
- **No full-text fallback** — fails if Ollama down (could add keyword search)
- **Embedding model mismatch** — `reindex --force` fixes; no auto-detection
- **No web UI** — vault is just files; use any markdown editor
