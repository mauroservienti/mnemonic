# mnemonic — Agent Context

## What this project is

A personal MCP memory server. The goal is to give LLMs persistent, cross-session memory that syncs across machines without running a permanent service or database.

The core idea: store everything as plain markdown files in a git repo, compute embeddings locally via Ollama, and expose it all through an MCP server. No Postgres, no Docker services that need to stay running — just files, git, and a Node process that the MCP client spawns on demand.

Inspired by [petabridge/memorizer](https://github.com/petabridge/memorizer) but without the Postgres/pgvector dependency.

## Dogfooding protocol

When implementing a new feature or behavior in mnemonic itself, dogfood the local MCP server as part of the work:
- Rebuild first (`npm run build`) so the stdio server uses the latest code.
- Prefer the repo-local helper (`npm run mcp:local` or `scripts/mcp-local.sh`) when wiring a local MCP client to mnemonic during development.
- Use the project-scoped `mnemonic` MCP server for real operations whenever the feature touches memory behavior, note formatting, retrieval, relationships, sync, or indexing.
- Prefer exercising the feature through MCP tools (`remember`, `update`, `get`, `relate`, `recall`, etc.) instead of writing `.mnemonic/` files directly.
- Mnemoize important implementation decisions, tradeoffs, and debugging findings through the MCP server so future agents can recall them.
- **Never fall back to direct file writes when in dogfooding mode.** If the MCP tool call fails, troubleshoot the tool or use `scripts/mcp-local.sh` directly rather than bypassing the server.

### Dogfooding troubleshooting

**Complex JSON payloads failing silently:** When sending multiline content or special characters via stdio, shell escaping can corrupt the JSON. Write payloads to a temp file first, then pipe to the MCP server:

```bash
# Write request to file
cat > /tmp/request.json << 'JSON'
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{...}}
JSON

# Pipe to MCP
(
  echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":0,"method":"initialize",...}'
  cat /tmp/request.json
) | ./scripts/mcp-local.sh
```

**Verify the result:** Always confirm notes were created by running `recent_memories` or `list` after `remember`. Truncated responses don't mean failure.

## Git commit message protocol

All MCP tools that modify memory state must follow a standardized git commit format to ensure consistency and traceability.

### Commit message format

```
tool(action): Brief description (50 chars max recommended)

Human-readable summary explaining the change (like a good commit message).

- Note: <id> (<title>)
- Notes: <count> notes affected
  - <id-1>
  - <id-2>
- Project: <project-name>
- Scope: project|global
- Tags: <tag1>, <tag2>
- Relationship: <from-id> <type> <to-id>
- Mode: <mode>
- Description: <additional context>
```

### Standard body fields

| Field | When to use | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `Summary` | Always - human-readable first line | First sentence of note content or change description |
| `Note` | Single note operation | `- Note: abc-123 (My Note Title)` |
| `Notes` | Multiple notes affected | `- Notes: 3 notes affected` |
| `Project` | Project-scoped operation | `- Project: mnemonic` |
| `Scope` | Storage location | `- Scope: project` |
| `Tags` | When relevant | `- Tags: design, architecture` |
| `Relationship` | Relate/unrelate operations | `- Relationship: abc-123 explains def-456` |
| `Mode` | Consolidation mode | `- Mode: supersedes` |
| `Description` | Additional context (optional) | `- Description: Additional technical details` |

### Implementation

Use `formatCommitBody()` helper in `src/index.ts`:

```typescript
// For remember: extract summary from note content
const summary = extractSummary(cleanedContent);

const commitBody = formatCommitBody({
  summary,
  noteId: id,
  noteTitle: title,
  projectName: project?.name,
  scope: writeScope,
  tags: tags,
});

await vault.git.commit(`remember: ${title}`, [files], commitBody);
```

### Tool-specific conventions

| Tool | Subject format | Summary source | Required body fields |
|------|----------------|----------------|---------------------|
| `remember` | `remember: <title>` | `summary` parameter (LLM-provided), fallback to first sentence | Summary, Note, Project, Scope, Tags |
| `update` | `update: <title>` | `summary` parameter (LLM-provided), fallback to "Updated X, Y, Z" | Summary, Note, Project, Tags |
| `forget` | `forget: <title>` | "Deleted note and cleaned up N reference(s)" | Summary, Note, Project |
| `move` | `move: <title>` | "Moved from X-vault to Y-vault" | Summary, Note, Project |
| `relate` | `relate: <title1> ↔ <title2>` | Context of relationship | Summary, Note, Project, Relationship |
| `unrelate` | `unrelate: <id1> ↔ <id2>` | Context of relationship removal | Summary, Note, Project |
| `consolidate` | `consolidate(<mode>): <title>` | `mergePlan.summary` (LLM-provided), fallback to "Consolidated N notes" | Summary, Note(s), Project, Mode |
| `prune` | `prune: removed N superseded note(s)` | "Pruned N superseded notes" | Summary, Note(s) |
| `policy` | `policy: <project> default scope <scope>` | "Set default scope to X" | Summary, Project |

**LLM-provided summary guidance:**
Tools marked with "LLM-provided" support optional `summary` parameters:
- `remember`: `summary` parameter
- `update`: `summary` parameter  
- `consolidate`: `mergePlan.summary` parameter

When provided, LLM should write commit-message-style summaries:
- Imperative mood ("Add", "Fix", "Update", not "Added", "Fixed")
- 50-72 characters recommended
- Explain the "why", not just the "what"
- Examples:
  - "Document JWT RS256 migration for distributed auth"
  - "Clarify consolidation rationale for release workflow notes"
  - "Fix outdated references to legacy package name"

When not provided, tools fall back to auto-generated descriptions.

**All new tools must follow this protocol.** Review existing implementations as templates.

## Design decisions and rationale

### Markdown + YAML frontmatter as storage
Notes are plain `.md` files with YAML frontmatter. This was chosen deliberately:
- Human-readable and editable outside the tool
- Git-diffable — merge conflicts are resolvable by a human
- One file per note means conflicts are isolated to the specific note that was edited simultaneously on two machines
- No lock-in — the vault is just a folder of text files

### Embeddings are local-only (gitignored)
Embeddings are stored as individual JSON files in `embeddings/` but this folder is gitignored. Rationale:
- Embeddings are derived/generated data — they can always be recomputed from the notes
- Committing them would introduce binary-ish merge conflicts that can't be resolved meaningfully (you can't merge two float arrays)
- At personal scale (hundreds to low thousands of notes), reindexing on a new machine is fast enough
- The `sync` tool handles this automatically: after pulling it embeds any notes that arrived without embeddings

Alternative considered: commit embeddings and use `merge=ours` strategy in `.gitattributes` to always take the local version on conflict. Valid approach if reindex time becomes painful at large scale.

### Project scoping via git remote URL
Project identity is derived by running `git remote get-url origin` from the provided `cwd`, then normalizing the URL to a stable slug:
- `git@github.com:acme/myapp.git` → `github-com-acme-myapp`
- `https://github.com/acme/myapp` → `github-com-acme-myapp`

This ensures the same project is recognized across machines regardless of local clone path. Fallback chain: git remote → git root folder name → directory name.

### Project-boosted recall, not hard filtering
When `recall` is called with a `cwd`, project-specific notes get a **+0.15 cosine similarity boost** rather than being the only results returned. This means:
- Project context surfaces first
- Global memories (user preferences, cross-project knowledge) are still accessible
- The LLM gets a richer, more complete context window

### Multi-vault architecture
There are two kinds of vault:

- **Main vault** (`~/mnemonic-vault` by default) — private global memories. Managed as its own git repo. Notes without a project scope live here.
- **Project vault** (`<git-root>/.mnemonic/`) — project-specific memories committed directly into the project repo. Created on demand when `remember` is called with a `cwd`. Collaborators cloning the project repo get the vault for free.

Routing rules:
- `cwd` identifies project context; write location is a separate choice.
- `remember` with `cwd` and `scope: "project"` → writes to the project vault (creates `.mnemonic/` if absent).
- `remember` with `cwd` and `scope: "global"` → writes to the main vault but keeps the project id/name in frontmatter.
- If `scope` is omitted, a saved per-project memory policy is used first; otherwise mnemonic falls back to `project` when `cwd` is present.
- If the policy is `ask`, do not guess. Ask one targeted question with two clear options: `Project vault` (recommended for shared project knowledge) or `Private main vault` (for personal/project-associated notes). Then call `remember` again with the chosen `scope`.
- `remember` without `cwd` → writes to the main vault as a normal global memory.
- `recall`, `list`, `get`, `sync`, `reindex` — operate on the project vault first, then the main vault.
- `relate`/`unrelate`/`forget` — find notes in any vault; commit changes per vault.

The main vault's own git repo is excluded from project-vault detection (`isMainRepo()` guard) so mnemonic's own directory is never treated as a project vault.

### Main vault config
Machine-local runtime settings live in the main vault's `config.json`. Use this for operational tuning and persistent MCP behavior that should survive across sessions without becoming a memory note. This includes `reindexEmbedConcurrency` and per-project memory policy defaults.

### Bidirectional sync with auto-embedding
`sync` does: fetch → record local HEAD → pull (rebase) → diff `notes/` to find what changed → push → embed any notes that arrived. This is a single tool call that handles the full sync cycle. Rebase is used instead of merge to keep history linear. `sync` always syncs the main vault; pass `cwd` to also sync the project vault.

### MCP output style
This MCP is optimized for direct LLM consumption, so tool outputs should stay text-first.

Output rules:
- Prefer compact, semantically explicit text over structured payloads.
- Always name both **project association** and **storage location** when both matter.
- Use stable labels such as `project:`, `stored:`, `policy:`, `updated:` so LLMs can scan reliably.
- Put the answer first, then supporting detail.
- Keep lists shallow and grouped by purpose; avoid dumping raw note bodies unless the tool is explicitly for retrieval.
- Only add structured/non-text responses if repeated LLM failures show that text is insufficient for a specific tool.

Token-efficiency rules:
- Optimize for clarity first, token use second.
- Keep default responses concise; make extra detail opt-in.
- Prefer one good summary tool over forcing multiple smaller calls.
- Avoid repeating the same metadata in multiple sections when one summary line is enough.
- Compress counts and state into a single line when it stays readable.
- Do not shorten labels so much that `project`, `stored`, or `policy` become ambiguous.

Formatting rules:
- Use short headings or lead lines for orientation tools.
- Use bullets for enumerations and state summaries.
- Keep wording consistent across tools for `project`, `scope`, `stored`, and `policy`.
- For distinction-heavy outputs, prefer explicit phrases like `project: mnemonic` and `stored: main-vault` instead of implying one from the other.

## Architecture

```
src/index.ts      — MCP server, all tool registrations
src/storage.ts    — read/write notes (markdown) and embeddings (JSON)
src/embeddings.ts — Ollama HTTP client, cosine similarity
src/git.ts        — git operations via simple-git, SyncResult type
src/project.ts    — detect project from cwd via git remote URL
src/vault.ts      — VaultManager: routing between main vault and project vaults
```

### Key types

```typescript
type RelationshipType = "related-to" | "explains" | "example-of" | "supersedes";

interface Relationship {
  id: string;
  type: RelationshipType;
}

// A stored memory
interface Note {
  id: string;           // slug-uuid e.g. "auth-bug-fix-a1b2c3d4"
  title: string;
  content: string;      // markdown body
  tags: string[];
  project?: string;     // stable project id e.g. "github-com-acme-myapp"
  projectName?: string; // human-readable e.g. "myapp"
  relatedTo?: Relationship[];
  createdAt: string;    // ISO 8601
  updatedAt: string;
}

// Local embedding cache
interface EmbeddingRecord {
  id: string;
  model: string;        // e.g. "nomic-embed-text"
  embedding: number[];  // 768-dimensional for nomic-embed-text
  updatedAt: string;
}

// Returned by git.sync()
interface SyncResult {
  hasRemote: boolean;
  pulledNoteIds: string[];   // notes that arrived/changed during pull
  deletedNoteIds: string[];  // notes deleted on remote
  pushedCommits: number;
}
```

### Vault layout

**Main vault** (private, `~/mnemonic-vault`):
```
~/mnemonic-vault/
  .gitignore          ← auto-written on startup, contains "embeddings/"
  notes/
    <id>.md           ← global memories
  embeddings/
    <id>.json         ← local only, never committed
```

**Project vault** (shared, inside the project repo):
```
<git-root>/
  .mnemonic/
    .gitignore        ← auto-written, contains "embeddings/"
    notes/
      <id>.md         ← project memories, committed to the project repo
    embeddings/
      <id>.json       ← local only, never committed
```

### Note format

```markdown

## Stack

- **TypeScript** (Node16 module resolution, ES2022 target)
- **@modelcontextprotocol/sdk** — MCP server, stdio transport
- **simple-git** — git operations
- **gray-matter** — markdown frontmatter parsing
- **zod** — MCP tool input schema validation
- **Ollama** (external, HTTP) — local embeddings via `nomic-embed-text`

## TypeScript type safety patterns

Use TypeScript's type system to catch errors at compile time and guide refactoring. Prefer patterns that let the compiler verify exhaustiveness.

### Exhaustive switch statements

When branching on union types, use `switch` with exhaustiveness checking. This ensures all cases are handled and causes compile errors when new union members are added.

**Preferred:**
```typescript
switch (consolidationMode) {
  case "delete":
    // handle delete
    break;
  case "supersedes":
    // handle supersedes
    break;
  default: {
    const _exhaustive: never = consolidationMode;
    throw new Error(`Unknown mode: ${_exhaustive}`);
  }
}
```

**Avoid:**
```typescript
if (consolidationMode === "delete") {
  // handle delete
} else {
  // Implicitly handles "supersedes" - no compiler verification
}
```

The `const _exhaustive: never` pattern forces TypeScript to verify all union members are handled. If a new mode is added to `ConsolidationMode`, the compiler will error until the switch is updated.

### String literal unions vs enums

Use string literal unions for domain values. They're more lightweight and integrate better with object literals and JSON.

**Preferred:**
```typescript
type ConsolidationMode = "supersedes" | "delete";
type RelationshipType = "related-to" | "explains" | "example-of" | "supersedes";
```

**Avoid:**
```typescript
enum ConsolidationMode {
  Supersedes = "supersedes",
  Delete = "delete"
}
```

### Type inference vs explicit types

Let TypeScript infer types when obvious, add explicit types for function boundaries and public APIs.

**Preferred:**
```typescript
// Inference is fine here
const lines: string[] = [];
lines.push("item");

// Explicit types for function boundaries
function processMode(mode: ConsolidationMode): string {
  // ...
}
```

### Unknown type for dynamic data

Use `unknown` instead of `any` when receiving data from external sources (APIs, user input). It forces type checking before use.

**Preferred:**
```typescript
function processConfig(raw: unknown): Config {
  if (typeof raw !== "object" || raw === null) {
    throw new Error("Invalid config");
  }
  // ...
}
```

## Things not to change without good reason

- **One file per note** — critical for git conflict isolation. Don't aggregate notes into a single file.
- **Embeddings gitignored** — deliberate. Don't start committing them unless reindex time becomes a real problem and you've added `.gitattributes merge=ours`.
- **Rebase on pull** — `git pull --rebase` keeps history linear. Don't switch to merge without understanding the tradeoff on a personal vault.
- **Project id from git remote, not local path** — the normalization in `src/project.ts` is what makes cross-machine consistency work. Local paths differ; remote URLs don't.
- **Similarity boost, not hard filter** — `recall` boosts project notes rather than excluding global ones. This is intentional: global memories (preferences, patterns) should remain accessible in project context.
- **`simpleGit()` in `GitOps.init()`, not the constructor** — the vault directory is created by `Storage.init()` which runs after `GitOps` is constructed. Calling `simpleGit()` in the constructor throws `GitConstructError`.
- **Project vault in `.mnemonic/` inside the project repo** — this makes notes shareable with collaborators via normal git. Don't move them back into the main vault.
- **`isMainRepo()` guard in `VaultManager`** — prevents the main vault's own git repo from being treated as a project vault. Don't remove it.

## Known limitations and future work

- **Bounded parallel embedding on reindex** — `embedMissingNotes()` runs with a small concurrency limit to speed up large reindexes without flooding Ollama. Increase carefully if local embedding throughput becomes a bottleneck.
- **No full-text fallback** — if Ollama is down, `recall` fails entirely. A fallback to simple keyword search over note content would improve resilience.
- **Embedding model mismatch** — if you change `EMBED_MODEL`, existing embeddings are stale. `reindex --force` fixes this but there's no automatic detection. Could check `EmbeddingRecord.model` against current model and re-embed mismatches.
- **No web UI** — memorizer has one. Out of scope for this project; the vault is just files so any markdown editor works for browsing.
