# mnemonic — Agent Context

## What this project is

A personal MCP memory server. The goal is to give LLMs persistent, cross-session memory that syncs across machines without running a permanent service or database.

The core idea: store everything as plain markdown files in a git repo, compute embeddings locally via Ollama, and expose it all through an MCP server. No Postgres, no Docker services that need to stay running — just files, git, and a Node process that the MCP client spawns on demand.

Inspired by [petabridge/memorizer](https://github.com/petabridge/memorizer) but without the Postgres/pgvector dependency.

## Design decisions and rationale

### Markdown + YAML frontmatter as storage
Notes are plain `.md` files with YAML frontmatter. This was chosen deliberately:
- Human-readable and editable outside the tool
- Git-diffable — merge conflicts are resolvable by a human
- One file per note means conflicts are isolated to the specific note that was edited simultaneously on two machines
- No lock-in — the vault is just a folder of text files

### Embeddings are local-only (gitignored)
Embeddings are stored as individual JSON files in `embeddings/` but this folder is gitignored. Rationale:
- Embeddings are derived/generated data — they can always be recomputed from the notes
- Committing them would introduce binary-ish merge conflicts that can't be resolved meaningfully (you can't merge two float arrays)
- At personal scale (hundreds to low thousands of notes), reindexing on a new machine is fast enough
- The `sync` tool handles this automatically: after pulling it embeds any notes that arrived without embeddings

Alternative considered: commit embeddings and use `merge=ours` strategy in `.gitattributes` to always take the local version on conflict. Valid approach if reindex time becomes painful at large scale.

### Project scoping via git remote URL
Project identity is derived by running `git remote get-url origin` from the provided `cwd`, then normalizing the URL to a stable slug:
- `git@github.com:acme/myapp.git` → `github-com-acme-myapp`
- `https://github.com/acme/myapp` → `github-com-acme-myapp`

This ensures the same project is recognized across machines regardless of local clone path. Fallback chain: git remote → git root folder name → directory name.

### Project-boosted recall, not hard filtering
When `recall` is called with a `cwd`, project-specific notes get a **+0.15 cosine similarity boost** rather than being the only results returned. This means:
- Project context surfaces first
- Global memories (user preferences, cross-project knowledge) are still accessible
- The LLM gets a richer, more complete context window

### Bidirectional sync with auto-embedding
`sync` does: fetch → record local HEAD → pull (rebase) → diff `notes/` to find what changed → push → embed any notes that arrived. This is a single tool call that handles the full sync cycle. Rebase is used instead of merge to keep history linear.

## Architecture

```
src/
  index.ts      — MCP server, all tool registrations
  storage.ts    — read/write notes (markdown) and embeddings (JSON)
  embeddings.ts — Ollama HTTP client, cosine similarity
  git.ts        — git operations via simple-git, SyncResult type
  project.ts    — detect project from cwd via git remote URL
```

### Key types

```typescript
// A stored memory
interface Note {
  id: string;           // slug-uuid e.g. "auth-bug-fix-a1b2c3d4"
  title: string;
  content: string;      // markdown body
  tags: string[];
  project?: string;     // stable project id e.g. "github-com-acme-myapp"
  projectName?: string; // human-readable e.g. "myapp"
  createdAt: string;    // ISO 8601
  updatedAt: string;
}

// Local embedding cache
interface EmbeddingRecord {
  id: string;
  model: string;        // e.g. "nomic-embed-text"
  embedding: number[];  // 768-dimensional for nomic-embed-text
  updatedAt: string;
}

// Returned by git.sync()
interface SyncResult {
  hasRemote: boolean;
  pulledNoteIds: string[];   // notes that arrived/changed during pull
  deletedNoteIds: string[];  // notes deleted on remote
  pushedCommits: number;
}
```

### Vault layout

```
~/mnemonic-vault/
  .gitignore          ← auto-written on startup, contains "embeddings/"
  notes/
    <id>.md           ← one file per memory
  embeddings/
    <id>.json         ← local only, never committed
```

### Note format

```markdown

## Stack

- **TypeScript** (Node16 module resolution, ES2022 target)
- **@modelcontextprotocol/sdk** — MCP server, stdio transport
- **simple-git** — git operations
- **gray-matter** — markdown frontmatter parsing
- **zod** — MCP tool input schema validation
- **Ollama** (external, HTTP) — local embeddings via `nomic-embed-text`

## Things not to change without good reason

- **One file per note** — critical for git conflict isolation. Don't aggregate notes into a single file.
- **Embeddings gitignored** — deliberate. Don't start committing them unless reindex time becomes a real problem and you've added `.gitattributes merge=ours`.
- **Rebase on pull** — `git pull --rebase` keeps history linear. Don't switch to merge without understanding the tradeoff on a personal vault.
- **Project id from git remote, not local path** — the normalization in `project.ts` is what makes cross-machine consistency work. Local paths differ; remote URLs don't.
- **Similarity boost, not hard filter** — `recall` boosts project notes rather than excluding global ones. This is intentional: global memories (preferences, patterns) should remain accessible in project context.

## Known limitations and future work

- **Sequential embedding on reindex** — `embedMissingNotes()` embeds one note at a time. For large vaults this could be parallelized with a concurrency limit.
- **No full-text fallback** — if Ollama is down, `recall` fails entirely. A fallback to simple keyword search over note content would improve resilience.
- **No relationship graph** — memorizer supports linking memories together. Not implemented here; could be added via a `relatedTo` frontmatter field.
- **Embedding model mismatch** — if you change `EMBED_MODEL`, existing embeddings are stale. `reindex --force` fixes this but there's no automatic detection. Could check `EmbeddingRecord.model` against current model and re-embed mismatches.
- **No web UI** — memorizer has one. Out of scope for this project; the vault is just files so any markdown editor works for browsing.
