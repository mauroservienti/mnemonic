Mnemonic now includes a repo-local helper for development dogfooding.

- Use npm run mcp:local or scripts/mcp-local.sh to rebuild and launch the current build/index.js MCP server.
- The helper exists so local MCP clients can target the latest code without manually rebuilding first.
- AGENT.md and README both point developers at this helper for local testing and MCP client configuration.
