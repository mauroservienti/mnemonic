Future direction: add runtime support for loading and unloading active project context so mnemonic can stay simple at small scale while handling larger numbers of projects and memories more efficiently.

- Keep global memories always available, but load project memories on demand.
- Cache active-project embeddings, summaries, and relationship neighborhoods.
- Unload inactive project caches with an LRU or idle-time policy.
- Expand from project-local memories to global memories only when similarity or relationships justify it.
- The goal is better multi-project recall latency and less noise without introducing a heavy always-on database architecture.
