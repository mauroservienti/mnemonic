Added fork-aware project identity overrides.

- Default project identity still comes from the `origin` remote so existing behavior remains unchanged.
- New MCP tools `set_project_identity` and `get_project_identity` let a forked repo use another remote such as `upstream` as its canonical project identity.
- The first iteration deliberately supports only remote-name overrides, not arbitrary `projectId` injection, to keep identity grounded in git metadata and avoid a premature escape hatch.
- Overrides are stored in main-vault `config.json`, applied during project detection, exposed in `detect_project`, and covered by unit plus MCP integration tests.
