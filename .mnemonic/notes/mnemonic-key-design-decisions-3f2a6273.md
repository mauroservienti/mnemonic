**One file per note:** Critical for git conflict isolation. Never aggregate notes into a single file.

**Embeddings gitignored:** Derived data, always recomputable. Committing them causes unresolvable merge conflicts (can't merge float arrays). `sync` auto-embeds notes that arrive from remote.

**Rebase on pull:** `git pull --rebase` keeps history linear. Don't switch to merge.

**Project ID from git remote URL, not local path:** `project.ts` normalizes remote URLs to stable slugs (e.g. `github-com-acme-myapp`). This makes cross-machine consistency work — local paths differ, remote URLs don't.

**Similarity boost, not hard filter:** `recall` gives project notes +0.15 cosine similarity boost rather than excluding global notes. Global memories (user prefs, cross-project patterns) remain accessible in project context.

**No auto-relationship via LLM:** Decided against using a local Qwen model to auto-build relationships. Small models lack session context, produce spurious edges, and corrupt the graph silently. Instead: agent instructions prompt `relate` immediately after `remember` while session context is warm.
