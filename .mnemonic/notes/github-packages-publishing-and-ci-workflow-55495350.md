As of March 2026, mnemonic has GitHub Actions automation for both verification and publishing.

- CI runs on push and pull_request and executes npm ci, npm run build, and npm test.
- Pushes to main publish a staging package to GitHub Packages using the staging dist-tag and a prerelease version like 0.1.0-staging.RUN_NUMBER.
- Tags matching v*.*.* publish stable packages to GitHub Packages after verifying the tag matches package.json.
- The published package name is @danielmarbach/mnemonic-mcp and consumers need the GitHub Packages registry configured for the @danielmarbach scope.
