Decision: `move_memory` should rewrite `project` and `projectName` from `cwd` when moving a note from the main vault into a project vault, but it should preserve existing project association when moving a project note out to the main vault.

Why: storage location and project association are separate concerns, but moving a global note into project-specific storage is usually correcting a missing project context rather than changing only physical location. The reverse move is different: a project note moved to the main vault should stay associated with the project for recall and relationships.

This came from a dogfooding incident where a note was created without `cwd`, landed in the main vault as a global note, and then needed both relocation and metadata normalization.
