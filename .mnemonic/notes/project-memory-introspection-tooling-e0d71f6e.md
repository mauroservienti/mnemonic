Added dedicated project introspection tools so an LLM can ask what mnemonic knows about a project without stitching together many calls.

- `project_memory_summary` gives a compact project overview, current write policy, storage counts, grouped themes, and recent changes.
- `recent_memories` returns the latest updated notes for a scope.
- `memory_graph` returns a compact adjacency list of visible relationships.
- `list` can now include previews, relations, storage location, and update timestamps.
- `detect_project` surfaces the current write policy so agents can adapt immediately.
