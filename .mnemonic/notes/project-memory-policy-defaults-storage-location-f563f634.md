Decision: project context and storage location are separate, and each project can keep a default write policy so agents only need to ask when necessary.

- `cwd` identifies project context.
- `scope: "project"` stores shared knowledge in `/.mnemonic/`.
- `scope: "global"` stores a private note in the main vault while keeping project association for recall and relationships.
- `remember` uses explicit `scope` first, then the saved project policy, then the fallback behavior.
- `set_project_memory_policy` supports `project`, `global`, and `ask`.
- When the policy is `ask`, agents should present a clear storage selection instead of guessing.
- `update` no longer rewrites project metadata just because `cwd` was passed for lookup.
