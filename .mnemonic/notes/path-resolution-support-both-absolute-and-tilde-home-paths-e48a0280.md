Key learning: configuration paths must support both absolute paths and home-directory shorthand (`~`), not just absolute paths.

## Problem observed

Using `path.resolve("~/mnemonic-vault")` does **not** expand `~`; Node treats it as a normal directory name relative to cwd. This can silently point mnemonic to the wrong vault.

## Fix applied

- Added path utilities in `src/paths.ts`:
  - `expandHomePath()` to expand `~`, `~/...`, and `~\\...` using `HOME`/`USERPROFILE`.
  - `resolveUserPath()` to combine home-expansion with absolute resolution.
  - `defaultVaultPath()` and `defaultClaudeHome()` defaults.
- Updated `src/index.ts` to use these helpers for:
  - MCP startup `VAULT_PATH`
  - `migrate` command `VAULT_PATH`
  - `import-claude-memory` `VAULT_PATH` and `CLAUDE_HOME`
  - `import-claude-memory` CLI options `--cwd=` and `--claude-home=`
- Added `tests/paths.test.ts` to lock behavior for:
  - tilde expansion
  - absolute path pass-through
  - USERPROFILE fallback
  - sane defaults when env is missing

## Audit findings

- Remaining `path.resolve(...)` calls in `config.ts`, `vault.ts`, and `storage.ts` operate on already-resolved/internal paths and are safe.
- Risk pattern to avoid: directly calling `path.resolve` on raw user/env path inputs.

## Rule going forward

All user-configurable filesystem paths should pass through a home-expansion helper before `path.resolve` so both absolute paths and home shorthand work predictably.
