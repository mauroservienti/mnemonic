Decision: lint markdown note bodies during `remember` and `update` so recalled content stays clean and consistent.

Implementation details:

- Run `markdownlint` before persisting note content.
- Auto-apply fixable issues like malformed headings, list spacing, and extra blank lines.
- Reject non-fixable issues after auto-fix so low-quality markdown does not get stored.
- Disable `MD013` (line length) and `MD041` (first line must be an H1) because note bodies are content fragments, not standalone documents.
- `get`, `relate`, `unrelate`, and `forget` now accept `cwd` so a fresh project-scoped server can resolve project-vault notes reliably.

Dogfooding note: the repo MCP server was rebuilt locally and this note was created and related through the local `mnemonic` MCP server, not by writing the vault files directly.
