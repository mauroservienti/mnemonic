mnemonic now treats push-after-mutation as configurable through the main vault config `mutationPushMode` with values `all`, `main-only`, and `none`. The default is `main-only`: main-vault mutations still auto-push, but project-vault mutations only commit locally so unpublished branches do not fail on remember/update/relate/forget/consolidate. Project vault initialization also commits `.mnemonic/.gitignore` without auto-pushing; `sync` remains the explicit catch-up path for both vault types.

Design decision: do not add a per-project push-mode override yet. Push policy is machine-local transport behavior rather than memory semantics, so a single global default is more predictable for users and agents. A future per-project override may be worth adding only if real workflows diverge, and if added it should be a narrow exception for project-vault mutations that falls back to the global default.
