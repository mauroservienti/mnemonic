Consolidates the migration robustness invariants with the later dogfooding lesson that some Kimi-authored tests drifted from those invariants, so there is one canonical memory covering both the intended behavior and how to validate future failing tests against it.

## Consolidated from:
### Migration infrastructure: robustness, ordering, idempotency, per-vault versioning
*Source: `migration-and-consolidate-robustness-hardening-cb012cfc`*

Migration hardening now has executable invariant coverage and explicit architecture guidance.

**Executable invariant checks:**

- State-machine style tests now cover dry-run -> execute -> repeat execute stability, plus interrupted-run rollback followed by clean retry.
- Cross-session coverage now verifies a project vault migrated in one session is skipped by a later broader run once its per-vault schema version is current.
- Atomic rollback, idempotency, ordering, and per-vault schema advancement remain covered in `tests/migration.test.ts`.

**Documented invariants:**

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` now records the core migration invariants: schema only advances after full vault success, failed runs do not flush partial writes, migrations must be idempotent, pending migrations execute in schema order, and fresh installs depend on `defaultConfig.schemaVersion` matching the latest schema.
- `src/config.ts` now embeds the checklist rule directly above `defaultConfig.schemaVersion`.
- `AGENT.md` keeps the same rule in the migration workflow guidance.

**Practical conclusion on formal methods:**

- With these tests and invariants in place, TLA+ is still probably not worth the cost right now.
- If migration orchestration later gains concurrency, resumability, or distributed coordination, revisiting a small formal model could make sense.

### Kimi-added tests drifted from migration and vault invariants
*Source: `kimi-added-tests-drifted-from-migration-and-vault-invariants-cc4a9d43`*

Dogfooding lesson: several recent Kimi-authored tests in `tests/migration.test.ts`, `tests/storage.test.ts`, and `tests/vault.test.ts` drifted from the actual system invariants and created false failures.

What drifted:

- Some migration tests still referenced an old migration name (`add-memory-version-field`) after the built-in migration was renamed to `v0.1.0-backfill-memory-versions`.
- Some storage tests expected legacy notes to keep `memoryVersion` undefined, but the designed compatibility behavior is to normalize missing or invalid versions to `0` during read.
- Some vault tests assumed `VaultManager` should preload or search every loaded project vault, but the intended behavior is current-project-first plus main-vault fallback.
- Some migration tests wrote schema state to `schema-version.json`, but the real vault schema source of truth is `config.json`.

Practical rule: when a new failing test comes from recent agent work, verify it against stored architecture decisions and current runtime behavior before changing production code. Fix stale tests when they contradict documented invariants; fix code only when the test exposes a real behavior bug.
