Tools registered in `src/index.ts`:

| Tool | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `detect_project` | Resolve `cwd` to stable project id via git remote URL; includes current write policy |
| `remember` | Write note + embedding with project context from `cwd` and storage controlled by `scope` |
| `set_project_memory_policy` | Set the default write scope and consolidation mode for a project |
| `get_project_memory_policy` | Show the saved default write scope for a project |
| `project_memory_summary` | Summarize what mnemonic knows about the current project |
| `recall` | Semantic search with optional project boost (+0.15) |
| `update` | Update content/title/tags, always re-embeds |
| `where_is_memory` | Show a memory's project association and actual storage location |
| `move_memory` | Move a memory between `main-vault` and `project-vault` without changing its id |
| `forget` | Delete note + embedding, commit; cleans up dangling `relatedTo` references |
| `list` | List memories with optional previews, relations, storage, timestamps, and `storedIn` filtering |
| `get` | Fetch one or more notes by exact id |
| `relate` | Create typed relationship (bidirectional by default) |
| `unrelate` | Remove relationship between two notes |
| `recent_memories` | Show the most recently updated memories for a scope and storage location |
| `memory_graph` | Show a compact adjacency list of note relationships |
| `sync` | fetch -> pull (rebase) -> push -> auto-embed pulled notes |
| `reindex` | Rebuild missing embeddings; uses bounded parallel embedding from `config.json` and `force=true` rebuilds all |
| `consolidate` | Analyze and consolidate memories — detect duplicates, suggest merges, execute with `supersedes` or `delete` mode |

Relationship types: `related-to`, `explains`, `example-of`, `supersedes`.

Main-vault operational config lives in `config.json`, including `reindexEmbedConcurrency`, per-project memory policies, and consolidation mode defaults.
