Early setup exposed a few enduring implementation constraints:

- `simpleGit()` must be created in `GitOps.init()`, not the constructor, because the vault directory does not exist until `Storage.init()` runs.
- Under Node16 module resolution, `simple-git` must be imported as `import { simpleGit } from "simple-git"`.
- The project needs an explicit `tsconfig.json` with Node16 module resolution and a `build/` output directory.
- Basic repo hygiene matters: ignore `node_modules/`, `build/`, and sourcemaps from the start.
