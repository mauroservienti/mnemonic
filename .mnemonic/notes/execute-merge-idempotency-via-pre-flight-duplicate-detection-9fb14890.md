Decision: make `consolidate` `execute-merge` idempotent by reusing an existing target note when retries repeat the same merge.

Why this approach:
- Server-side duplicate detection is reliable for humans, LLMs, and thin MCP clients even when they lose retry state.
- It preserves the existing caller contract and note ID generation model.
- It keeps note identity decoupled from the exact merge input set.
- A persistent cache or operation log would add extra invalidation and consistency complexity for little value at mnemonic's current scale.
- Caller-supplied target IDs remain a possible future enhancement for advanced clients, but they are not reliable enough as the baseline guarantee for LLM-driven retries.

Implementation details:
- Before creating a new target, `executeMerge()` intersects the `supersedes` targets referenced by all source notes.
- It reuses a candidate only when the title matches exactly and the candidate ID shares the target title slug prefix.
- On reuse, the existing target note is updated in place, `createdAt` is preserved, source relationships remain deduplicated, and the result text makes the idempotent reuse explicit.
- Integration coverage verifies repeated `execute-merge` calls produce one target note and update the existing consolidated content instead of creating duplicates.
