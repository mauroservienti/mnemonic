# mnemonic

A local MCP memory server backed by plain markdown + JSON files, synced via git. No database. Project-scoped memory with semantic search.

## How it works

```
~/mnemonic-vault/
  .gitignore             ← auto-created, gitignores embeddings/
  notes/
    setup-notes-a1b2c3.md          ← global memory
    auth-bug-fix-d4e5f6.md         ← project: github-com-acme-myapp
  embeddings/                      ← local only, never committed
    setup-notes-a1b2c3.json
    auth-bug-fix-d4e5f6.json
```

Notes are plain markdown with YAML frontmatter — readable, diffable, mergeable.
Embeddings stay local (gitignored) and are rebuilt on each machine with `reindex`.

## Project scoping

Project identity is derived from the **git remote URL** of the working directory, normalized to a stable slug (e.g. `github-com-acme-myapp`). This means the same project is recognized consistently across machines, regardless of local clone paths.

If no remote is configured, the git root folder name is used. If not in a git repo at all, the directory name is used.

When `recall` is called with a `cwd`, memories from the matching project are **boosted by +0.15 similarity score** and appear first in results, followed by relevant global memories. This means you get project-specific context without losing access to cross-project knowledge.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+

  ```bash
  ollama pull nomic-embed-text
  ```

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Tools

| Tool             | Description                                                                     |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `detect_project` | Identify the project for a given `cwd` (git remote → slug)                     |
| `remember`       | Store a memory — optionally scoped to a project via `cwd`                       |
| `recall`         | Semantic search — project-boosted when `cwd` provided                           |
| `update`         | Update content, title, or tags; optionally re-scope to a project                |
| `forget`         | Delete a memory by id                                                            |
| `list`           | List memories — filter by project scope and/or tags                             |
| `sync`           | Bidirectional sync — pulls remote, pushes local commits, auto-embeds new notes  |
| `reindex`        | Manually rebuild missing embeddings (sync does this automatically)              |

## Recall scopes

All tools that accept a `cwd` also accept a `scope` parameter:

- `"all"` *(default)* — project memories boosted, then global
- `"project"` — only memories for the detected project
- `"global"` — only memories with no project association

## Multi-machine workflow

```bash
# Machine A: use Claude normally — auto-commits and pushes on every remember/forget

# Machine B (first time):
git clone git@github.com:you/mnemonic-vault.git ~/mnemonic-vault
# Then ask Claude to run the `sync` tool — it will pull, push, and auto-embed in one step
```

After the first sync, just call `sync` whenever you switch machines. It handles pull, push, and embedding in one shot — no separate `reindex` needed.

## Note format

Each note is standard markdown with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: Auth bug fix approach
tags: [auth, bugfix]
project: github-com-acme-myapp
projectName: myapp
createdAt: 2026-03-07T10:00:00.000Z
updatedAt: 2026-03-07T10:00:00.000Z

## Mnemonic Memory System

You have access to a long-term memory system via the `mnemonic` MCP server.
Use it proactively — don't wait to be asked.

### On every session start (in a project)
1. Call `detect_project` with the working directory to identify project context.
2. Call `recall` with a broad query like "project overview architecture decisions"
   and `cwd` set — to surface relevant prior context before doing any work.
3. If the user mentions something you don't recognize, call `recall` before asking
   them to explain — you may already know it.

### When to call `remember`
Store a memory whenever you learn something useful to know in a future session:

- **Decisions made**: architecture choices, library selections, rejected
  approaches and why ("we chose X over Y because Z")
- **User preferences**: coding style, communication style, tools they like/dislike
- **Project context**: what the project does, who it's for, current priorities
- **Bug fixes**: non-obvious fixes, especially ones that explain *why* something broke
- **Tribal knowledge**: anything the user had to explain that isn't obvious from the codebase
- **Recurring patterns**: if the user corrects you twice on the same thing, remember it

When in doubt, store it. Storage is cheap; re-explaining context is expensive.

### When to call `update`
- When a stored memory becomes outdated — a decision was revisited, a dependency
  upgraded, a pattern changed.
- When you recall something and notice it's stale or partially wrong.
- Don't create a new memory for something that already exists — update the old one.

### When to call `forget`
- When a memory is fully superseded and keeping it would cause confusion.
- Don't forget things just because they're old — outdated context can still be
  useful if clearly dated.

### Scoping rules
- Pass `cwd` for anything specific to the current project.
- Omit `cwd` for things that apply across all projects (user preferences,
  cross-project patterns, general facts about the user).
- When recalling, always pass `cwd` if you're in a project — the boost ensures
  project context surfaces first without losing global knowledge.

### Memory quality
- Titles should be searchable: "JWT RS256 migration rationale" not "auth stuff"
- Content should be self-contained: written as if you'll have no other context
  when you read it later.
- Tags should be consistent: use the same terms you'd use in a search query.
- Be specific about dates and versions when they matter:
  "as of March 2026, using Prisma 5.x"
```
